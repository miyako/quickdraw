# 4D CLI component adoption and acceptance

Read the repository root `AGENTS.md` first: it is the canonical detailed
THINK/ASK → RUN playbook, including stop rules and the dated UUID case study.
Then read `README.md`, `template.json`, class documentation and relevant
scripts/tests. Resolve all paths below from the repository root, not this folder.

## Architecture gate: CLI-backed component or host-installed plug-in

This template supports a component facade over a **bundled native CLI executable**
running as a separate process through `4D.SystemWorker`. Install the component
through the Dependency manager or the host's `Components/` folder; the CLI ships
in `Resources/bin/`. If native 4D SDK integration is required, choose a **separate
native 4D plug-in architecture**, with the plug-in installed in the host and its
installation/compatibility requirements explicit.

Never generate or propose a component-over-plug-in hybrid as a self-contained
component solution. A component cannot privately load or deploy a 4D plug-in;
component packaging cannot hide, eliminate or satisfy host plug-in installation.
Wrapping commands from an already installed plug-in leaves an explicit host
dependency; this is not a blanket claim about whether host code can call those
commands. Component compiler `Libraries/` and standalone CLI libraries are not
a private 4D plug-in backend. Follow AGENTS.md's architecture gate before adoption
or packaging; do not turn an SDK requirement into a component resource.

## Adoption and acceptance sequence

1. **THINK / ASK:** select the architecture above, then establish exact
   case-sensitive GitHub identity, one
   user-selected language, independent unique namespace, CLI basename, feature
   API/protocol/error/limits, licenses and acceptance scope. Never initialize the
   original template repository or guess material missing decisions.
2. **Inspect:** `python3 scripts/doctor.py --root .` reports configuration,
   platform/tools; optional `--tool4d PATH` checks the supplied tool. Do not
   interpret this read-only report as feature/runtime acceptance.
3. **Initialize the destination only:** use the initializer flags documented
   in AGENTS.md. It records the feature description and selects/renames a starter;
   it does not implement the feature.
4. **Replace the whole feature contract:** API class, CLI, docs, language/Python
   tests, `tests/cli-contract.json` native smoke vectors, host fixture and `tests/host/contract.json`
   feature/report expectations, metadata/notices and compiler completion metadata.
   Preserve the registry's separate generic execution checks. Optional
   `python3 scripts/rename_feature.py --root . --class NAME` is a bounded Greeting
   identity rewrite, not automatic feature implementation.
5. **Preserve real 4D execution:** keep `_CLI`/`_Process` generic, quote into
   SystemWorker command-line Text, guard scalar values before object-instance
   checks, use strict `Position(Char(0); argument; *)`, close stdin and preserve
   separate stdout/stderr/exitCode/system errors. Test native argument round trips.
6. **Validate:** follow AGENTS.md's Python/icon/native CLI/source-host/real
   compiler/pack/unpack/compiled-host sequence. Optional
   `python3 scripts/accept_local.py --root . --repository OWNER/NAME --tool4d PATH`
   orchestrates the existing stages and records `build/acceptance.json`.
   `--cross` is optional **Go-only artifact production**, not native foreign
   execution; available Rosetta CLI tests are separate translated evidence.
   Rust/C++ cross mode is unsupported. Packed output is `dist/<repository>.zip`
   only when required artifact/package checks succeed.
   Without `--cross`, all three current artifacts/manifests are still needed.
   For Rust/C++, restore binaries plus `build-manifest.json` from same-commit
   native CI into `build/<target>/`; never mix stale or changed inputs/outputs.
   Every 4D project opened headlessly (component, host fixture,
   `tooling/compiler/`, any added project) must ship
   `Project/Sources/dependencies.json` **before its first open**, e.g.
   `{"version":2100,"dependencies":{}}`; otherwise 4D can show a modal
   "import components" dialog that hangs `--startup-method` runs (see AGENTS.md).
7. **Report:** identify exact revision/platform/tools, commands, artifact/evidence
   paths, `passed` / `failed` / `not_run` per check and blockers. Partial local success
   is **NOT release ready**. Do not publish or add credentials without approval.
   Unsigned free tool4d local compilation needs no license/signing secrets.
   Manual initialized CI with `FOURD_ENABLED=true` retains an accepted compiled
   ZIP and adjacent evidence without publishing. Release signing is implemented:
   `release-policy.json.apple_notarized_versions` defaults to unsigned; a listed
   version or manual `require_apple_signing` opts in. Only that branch receives
   the signing secrets, takes the signing identity from the imported
   certificate (exactly one Developer ID Application identity of
   `NOTARYTOOL_TEAM_ID`; optional `CODESIGN_APPLE_ID` only pins it), signs an isolated copy, notarizes/staples its DMG, repacks
   the ZIP from the final mounted DMG and reruns exact final ZIP compiled-host
   acceptance. Missing credentials or signing errors never downgrade to unsigned.
   Keep CI nonpublishing plus two manual release-facing actions: **Bump version**
   in `bump-version.yml` and **Build** in `build.yml`. Bump version accepts
   patch/minor/major (default patch). `release_source.py bump` validates immutable
   dispatch SHA, clean checkout, current version surfaces and selected branch
   remote HEAD exactly equal to dispatch SHA (fails if moved). It increments the
   greater of current authoritative source version and stable `X.Y.Z`/legacy
   `vX.Y.Z` history, or source alone without stable history; each Bump increments
   source, never reusing an old retry candidate. It synchronizes version metadata/contracts/
   docs and commits only synchronized source metadata to the explicitly selected
   dispatch branch, staging bounded surfaces and non-force pushing only that
   branch. It performs no builds, tags, releases or workflow dispatch.
   Separately authorized Build remains main-only and accepts only optional
   `require_apple_signing`, never version/tag/bump/mode input. It checks out
   immutable dispatch `github.sha`, derives stable prefix-free `X.Y.Z` from
   synchronized source metadata. Before expensive reusable CI, nonmutating
   `release_source.py` preflight requires main dispatch/HEAD exactly equal to
   `github.sha`, clean/exact source, all version surfaces validated with
   `bump_release.plan` at the same version, source version greater than stable
   published tag history, no collisions and main ancestry. Main may advance
   later, but source stays at dispatch SHA, never newer main HEAD. Pass that same full SHA
   through CI, acceptance and final publication, preserving every package,
   compiler, runtime, provenance and signing gate. Downloaded asset/hash/
   final-host acceptance precedes tag/release creation; recheck collisions and
   ancestry before publication. Never clobber, precreate tags or enable tag-push
   publication. Build does not bump or commit source metadata.

## Canonical generated workflow contract

Before initialization or workflow tests, install the pinned development-only
`tooling/requirements-workflow.txt` in a Python environment and run
`python3 scripts/workflow_contract.py --root .`. Initialization, CI, Bump version and Build
enforce the inherited workflows. Use `workflow-contract.json` only for supported
configuration; see [the extension contract](../../../AGENTS.md#enforced-generated-contract-and-bounded-configuration).
Follow [the release entry points and handoff rules](../../../AGENTS.md#release-entry-points-handoff-and-bounded-waiting)
for evidence and event-driven waiting. Do not invent per-project release flows.

## Optional credential setup

For optional signed-release credential setup, follow the canonical
[user-owned setup and reuse guide](../../../AGENTS.md#user-owned-credential-setup-and-reuse).
Inspect the actual destination workflow first: unsigned/Windows-only workflows
may need no Apple secrets. The bundled
[scripts/set-release-secrets.sh](../../../scripts/set-release-secrets.sh)
is **user-run only** and sets the six required secrets. Signed Build infers
the signing identity from the imported certificate; `CODESIGN_APPLE_ID` is an
optional pin (identity or SHA-1 fingerprint, not email). Agents must not execute the helper or real Keychain/secret operations,
read values, choose certificates or ask for secrets in chat; only
`gh secret list --repo OWNER/REPOSITORY` names/timestamps may be inspected.
Setup never authorizes publication or changes the unsigned-default policy.

## Component release versions and tags

New component release tags must equal the prefix-free SemVer version:
`0.1.0`, never `v0.1.0`. Build publishes stable `X.Y.Z`; package validation,
signing proofs and publication reject a `v` prefix. Do not rename/delete/move
published history or automatically alias old tags/releases; legacy stable tags
are read only to avoid downgrades. New builds need fresh acceptance evidence
and unchanged exact-version signing policy gates. Upstream Actions/toolchain
tags and historical external URLs are not component-tag rewrite targets.
This component rule is not a native 4D plug-in tag convention.

The official [Follow 4D version guide](https://blog.4d.com/follow-4d-version-a-smarter-way-to-manage-your-dependencies/)
requires **host-version-aligned** LTS `x.y.p` (e.g. `20.2.3`) or R-release
`xRy.p` (e.g. `20R3.2`) tags. Ordinary component SemVer `0.1.0` does not enable
Follow4D matching or prove host compatibility. This template does not implement
non-SemVer R-tag publication; do not invent support or select that dependency
rule without a deliberate host-aligned distribution contract. The resolver
uses the tag, not a custom release display title. See AGENTS.md for migration.

## Discovery is supported, invocation is not guaranteed

Official Copilot documentation supports project skills at
`.github/skills/<lowercase-hyphen-name>/SKILL.md`, with YAML `name` and
`description`; Copilot chooses relevant skills using the prompt/description.
This file does not install a toolchain, run scripts automatically, or guarantee
that every client/version/session sees it. No shell tools are pre-approved here.

On a supported Copilot CLI, start a new session or use `/skills reload`, then
`/skills info 4d-cli-component` to inspect discovery. These are **CLI slash
commands**, not shell commands; do not run them through Bash. Other surfaces
use their documented controls. If unavailable, read this file and AGENTS.md
directly and report skill invocation as unverified.
